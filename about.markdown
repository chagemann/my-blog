## Hi, Iâ€™m Carsten!
 
I am a software engineer working in the IAM stack and developing mobile applications and libraries for Android.

Since 2007, I have been working for IBM Security and since 2010 from the Gold Coast, Australia. My focus areas are identity and access management, multi-factor and passwordless authentication, security by design, and data privacy.
