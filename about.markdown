## Hi, Iâ€™m Carsten! ðŸ‘‹
 
I am a software engineer specializing in the IAM stack, with a focus on developing mobile applications and libraries for Android.

 Since 2007, I have been working at IBM, and since 2010, I have been based on the Gold Coast, Australia. My expertise spans digital credentials, identity and access management (IAM), multi-factor and password-less authentication, and data privacy.
